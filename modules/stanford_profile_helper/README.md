Releases
---

Steps to build a new release:
- Checkout the latest commit from the `8.x-1.x` branch.
- Create a new branch for the release.
- Commit any necessary changes to the release branch.
  -  These may include, but are not necessarily limited to:
    - Update the version in any `info.yml` files, including in any submodules.
    - Update the CHANGELOG to reflect the changes made in the new release.
- Make a PR to merge your release branch into `main`
- Give the PR a semver-compliant label, e.g., (`patch`, `minor`, `major`).  This may happen automatically via Github actions (if a labeler action is configured).
- When the PR is merged to `main`, a new tag will be created automatically, bumping the version by the semver label.
- The github action is built from: [semver-release-action](https://github.com/K-Phoen/semver-release-action), and further documentation is available there.

      value: "<p>The findings, published online on April 2 in the journal Nature, offer new insights into the limits of perception and could aid in the design of so-called neuroprosthetics – devices that enable people to regain some lost sensory capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the new study, the researchers measured the activity of neurons in mice brains as the rodents visually discriminated between similar, but not identical imagery. By analyzing data gathered from around 2,000 simultaneously recorded neurons in each mouse, the researchers discovered strong supporting evidence for a theory that perceptual limitations are caused by “correlated noise” in neural activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, because neurons are highly interconnected, when one randomly responds incorrectly and misidentifies an image, it can influence other neurons to make the same mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You can think of correlated noise like a type of ‘groupthink,’ in which neurons can act like lemmings, with one heedlessly following another into making a mistake,” said co-senior author Surya Ganguli, an associate professor of applied physics in the School of Humanities and Sciences (H&amp;S).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remarkably, the visual system is able to cut through about 90% of this neuronal noise, but the remaining 10% places a limit on how finely we can discern between two images that look very similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With this study, we’ve helped resolve a puzzle that’s been around for over 30 years about what limits mammals – and by extension humans – when it comes to sensory perception,” said co-senior author Mark Schnitzer, a professor of biology and of applied physics in H&amp;S and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>\r\n"

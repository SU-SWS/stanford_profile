# CSL Styles

These styles are pulled from https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles with customized formatting to more
accurately match the defined styles. To see the difference between locally hosted files and the repository,
simply do `diff [style].xml [drupalroot]/../vendor/citation-style-language/styles-distribution/[style].csl`. This will
produce a difference output similar to a patch file.

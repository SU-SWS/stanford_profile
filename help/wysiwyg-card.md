#Text Area Card

The Text Area Card is a great alternative to the Card paragraph types.  We recommend using multiple Text Area Cards per row.

1. Drag and drop the Text Area paragraph to the place where you would like to display the Text Area Card.
2. Within the Text Area body, add and style text.
3. Add the image to top of the text area. The image Display should be set to Default. No additional image styles are necessary.
4. Once the image has been added, select the blue Continue button located in the bottom right corner of the Text Area pop-up and save the page.
